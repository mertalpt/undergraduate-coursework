<h1>Assignment 1: Cityscape Generator with WebGL</h1>
<hr>
<center>

<b>Due Date: November 1, 2018, Thursday</b> 
<p>
<b>The demonstration of the assignment will be during the class hour 
(15:40-16:30) in EA204.</b> 
</p><p>
<b>Every student must attend the demonstration in the class.</b>
</p><p>
Grade Value: 15 %

<h3> Important Notice</h3>
<b>
<p>
This assignment will NOT be done in groups. Every individual student 
must do his/her homework.
</p>
<p>
The assignments will be submitted to MOSS (Measure Of Software 
Similarity), which is an
automatic system for determining the similarity of programs. It is very 
successful in identifying the similar codes even if you change variable 
names, indentation, places of functions, and so on. Any similarities between 
the programs of students in the class, as well  as any similarities to the 
programs on the Internet, mandates disciplinary action.
</p>
<p>
You will demonstrate your programs to Dr. Güdükbay in the scheduled time. 
All the students must be physically available in the demonstrations. Demonstrations
are a kind of exam. You will be asked questions to understand your contribution to
the assignments in the demos.
</p>

<p>
If you need any assistance, you must request it from the TA. email: 
aytek.aman@cs
</p>

<p>
You must also submit your source codes (including online documentation
(comments and a README.txt file explaining how it is compiled and run) to
the TA. You should email (with the Subject CS465 Assignment #1) to Aytek
Aman (aytek.aman@cs) a single zip file named as
LastName_Name_CS465_Asst1.zip, containing two directories:
Source, Executable, and a README.txt file describing how to compile
and run your assignment.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>You will design and implement a simple procedural WebGL app that will
 paint a very simple cityscape. You need to generate the paintings using
 these simple parameters:

</p><ul>
  <li><b>number of houses (<i>n</i>):</b> In the painting, there will be <b><i>n</i></b> houses exactly.</li>
  <li><b>max number of stories (<i>m</i>):</b> Each house can have stories up to <b><i>m</i></b> (determine the
number of stories for each house between 1 and m randomly) and will have random colors except the roof and the windows.</li>
</ul>

Between each pair of houses, there will be a tree.
There should be a ground plane, sky and the sun.
Clouds will be drawn interactively. Once you generate the cityscape 
using the parameters, you should be able to click on the canvas to add 
corner vertices of a cloud. Once you hit right-click (or some other 
key), this will indicate that cloud drawing is finished. Users can paint
 as many clouds as they want.

In the UI, there should be a slider for each parameter (number of houses
 and max number of stories). There should be a button named "Generate". 
When pressed, a new cityscape should be generated from scratch. In the 
following figure sample cityscape drawing is shown (number of houses = 
4, max number of stories = 3).
<p></p>

<img src="CS-465%20Assignment%201_files/city.png" alt="Simple cityscape" width="50%">

<p>You need to use suitable GL primitives for each entity (quads, tris etc). <b>Don't hardcode the coordinates of the vertices.</b>
 For example, circular entities (sun and tree tops) should have at least
 32 segments which you can compute using trigonometric functions. You 
should be careful about the order of drawings (clouds should be in front
 of the sun etc.).

Don't be afraid to get creative! You could add random variations to 
entities to generate better looking drawings. Also, additional effects 
&amp; entities are welcome!

Since each drawing will be random, you might want to save them if one of
 them looks interesting. Provide a save &amp; load mechanism which saves
 the properties of the drawings (coordinates and colors of the houses, 
windows etc.). You should be able to load these files from disk and get 
the exact drawing. (Don't save the whole framebuffer pixel by pixel!). 
You can also save the whole drawing by just saving the random seed and 
the two parameters. However, for this assignment, you are not allowed to
 do that. </p>

<p>
<b>Important: Always comment your code. The code will also be checked during the demos.</b>

</p><hr>
<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
<ul>
<li>Does your program meet the requirements listed above? Your programs will be graded with respect to the number
of the requirements they satisfy.</li>
<li>You should construct an instructive user interface for your program.
 The user interface should be easy to use. There should not be any menus
 without any information. For example, having an empty window without 
any information but opening a menu when a mouse button is clicked is not
 a good user interface. The functionality of the user interface is a 
part of the grading criteria.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>
<b>
Please make sure your program runs in preparation for the demos.
</b>
</p>
<p>
You could use simple HTML UI elements or JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS, jQWidgets,... etc.) UI widget libraries.
</p>
There are vast number of WebGL examples on the web. <b>(Do not use these codes directly)</b>.
 If you use some code for user interface generation or some other 
purpose with modifications, you must state so at the beginning of that 
code segment (e.g., method header ) and properly state how you modified 
that code segment.
<p>
	<b>Also DO NOT use the third party wrappers like three.js. Use WebGL from the scratch</b>.
</p>
