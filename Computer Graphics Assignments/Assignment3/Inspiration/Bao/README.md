# SuperQuadric-Webgl
This program is a html file using WebGL, built on JavaScript that  first build a surface of of superellipsoid. The mesh can be built with different bulge factors that makes it has different shape.
The program then apply Gouraud shaded with Phong lighting model to create effect on the surface of the mesh.
Finallty the program will map a 2D texture, by dividing up the mesh into "slices and dices", map an image to the corresponding point on the surface of the mesh, combine with the light effect that make surface of the ellipsoid to be special.  

The html file is in written in JavaScript and need a support matrix.js, an image 'warm.png' and ellipsoid.js files 
Open superquadric.html file to open webpage.
Rotate the mesh by dragging.
Choosing different bulge factors to see different shape.
