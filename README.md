# Undergraduate Coursework Collection
This repository contains select projects, labs and assignments from my undergraduate education. 
Purpose of this collection is to give an overview of the skills I have acquired in my degree
to future employers and academic boards.

I have begun my BS in Computer Engineering in Fall 2016 and will have it finished in Fall 2020.
Most of this work is from my time in Bilkent University and some from my ERASMUS exchange semester
from Kungliga Tekniska högskolan where I took graduate level courses.

The coursework will be labeled and explained in the following.
