Consider the following program with annotated while loop:

y = 0;
{x ≥ 0 ∧ x + y = x0}
while (x > 0) {
   x = x - 1;
   y = y + 1
}

and the contract:

(x ≥ 0 ∧ x = x0, y = x0)

Show that the program meets the contract by computing a verification condition. The verification condition should be computed with two techniques (see Lecture 2 slides):

    1. Dilian’s Verification Condition Generator (VC-function) [[Page 18 has what I need]]
    2. Weakest Precondition Calculation for the Intermediate Language (wp-function) [[Page 25 has what I need]]

Show clearly all steps in the computation, applying one rule at a time (and indicate which).

Compare the two resulting formulas.
