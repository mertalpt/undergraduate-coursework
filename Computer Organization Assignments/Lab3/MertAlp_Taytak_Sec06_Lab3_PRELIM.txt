2. MIPS Program to Delete Given Value from the Linked List

#####
#  - Can you return the deleted node to the heap?
#    We are only changing the pointers of the linked list to remove
# the given node from the chain, the node itself is not deleted.
# So, it can be found in the heap.
#    If the question is can you deallocate the memory, my previous
# research showed me that if your emulator supports it you can use
# sbrk with negative values to shrink the heap but you can't remove
# something from the middle this way. A solution I saw is to keep a
# linked list of unused nodes to keep track of usable memory in the
# heap.
#####

# Description:
# 	Delete the first element from the linked list
# 	with the given value
# Arguments:
# 	a0: Pointer to the linked list
# 	a1: Value of the element to delete
# Returns:
# 	v0: 0 if deletion successful, -1 if not
# 	v1: Pointer to the head of the linked list
Delete_x:
	
	# Start with -1 in $v0, change to 0 if deletion is made
	li 	$v0, -1
	
	# Check if first node is the node to delete
	lw	$t0, 0($a0) 	# Pointer to second node
	lw	$t1, 4($a0)	# Value in the first node
	beq	$t1, $a1, deleteX_deleteHead
		
	# Set temporary variables
	move	$t0, $a0 	# Address to current node
	lw	$t1, 0($t0) 	# Address to the next node
	lw 	$t2, 4($t1)	# Value in the next node
	
	deleteX_loop:
		# Check if next node is to be deleted
		beq 	$t2, $a1, deleteX_deleteNext	
		
		# Iterate to next loop
		move 	$t0, $t1
		lw	$t1, 0($t0)
		
		# Check if end of list
		beq	$t1, $zero, deleteX_endOfList
		
		# Load next value
		lw 	$t2, 4($t1)

		lw	$t1, 0($t1)
		
		# Bypass next node to delete it from the list
		sw	$t1, 0($t0)
		
		# Change $v1 to head
		move 	$v1, $a0

		li 	$v0, 0
